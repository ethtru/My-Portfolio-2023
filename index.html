    <p>About Me</p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing in 2009. Since then, I have held several jobs in the business space ranging from recruitment to healthcare management. In the spring of this year, I decided to make a change and harness a new skill within the web development community. This shift has allowed me to use my creativity and problem solving skills to develop attractive, functioning web applications. Please have a look around my site to see some of my work!
