# My-Portfolio-2023

Portfolio of work by Ethan Trudell

## ##H2 **bold text**Description:

This is an application that holds my work so far in this bootcamp. The other two images in the work sections are placeholders for future application. Being new to we development, my only work to publish at this point is the week one challenge.

Modifications:
This is the first application I have built from scratch. All HTML and CSS elements were written by me to develop this portfolio.
